4. <b>Finisher and Batting Prowess:</b> Dhoni's batting prowess, particularly in the limited-overs formats, is legendary. He is known for his ability to finish matches with his powerful hitting and calculated stroke play. His "helicopter shot" became iconic in the cricketing world. Dhoni's ability to control the innings and accelerate when needed has been crucial for India in countless matches.
